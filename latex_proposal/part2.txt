Why asip in embedded systems?
application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) deliver greater computational efficiencies than general purpose processors
Application Specific Instruction-set Processors(ASIPs) are designed
to exploit the special characteristics of an application or a set of applications
to meet the desired cost, performance and power requirements.
In the world of embedded-
processor systems that are geared to
solve a single application (or a limited
class
of applications) very efficiently,

what is scad/ exposed datapath architecture
how can scad aip be benificial/whats the claim in all

Synchronous-
control Asynchronous-data or SCAD is a new processor architecture which ex-
ploits a large amount of instruction-level parallelism. SCAD belongs therefore to
the family of exposed data path architectures pioneered by explicit data graph
execution (EDGE) architectures.

Due to its modular structure, SCAD is an ideal processor template for application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIP) (with customized datapath but without the inflexibility and design cost of fixed function hardware accelerators.)

Our aim here is to evaluate whether and how
SCAD could be used to implement application specific processor


intro

explain scad more 
say it is beneficial to implement asfu in scad and obtainmore gain than compared to risc arch
